Repository for programming assigment Getting and Cleaning Data Course

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

### Content

Solution contains script run_analysis.R and code book code_book.md which describes tidy data set values.

### Using example
To run this script you should install plyr package first.
Usage is very simple and example you can see below:

source("run_analysis.R")

runAnalysis()

In working directory you should be able to find tidy data set file named tidy_dataset.txt.
